# Tasktracker

1. When the user is not log in, he/she can not see the navigation bar.
2. When the user sign in the app, he/she can see all the tasks in the database,
all the users in the database. He/She can only operate(edit, delete) his own
user account or tasks. When they are worker, they can only show and edit the task.
3. He/she can also see the tasks assigned to others and their own tasks to do.
4. When the worker finishes the work, they can click the edit, and input the time
they used and if they have completed the task. Here I assume both the initiator
and worker can edit all the content of the task, sometimes the task needs collaboration
instead of one manage the other.
5. When other user tried to edit other's file through /users/id, the system will
detect it and put corresponding warning flash.
