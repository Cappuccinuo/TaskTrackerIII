1. User need to be logged in first.
2. If user has an account, he/she can directly log in by typing email and
password. Otherwise he/she needs to go to sign up page, type in name, email
and password to sign up.
3. User can click All Users on Nav bar to see all the users.
4. In tasks dropdown, there are four list item
 - a. All Tasks to check all tasks in database.

 - b. New Task to create a new task. Fill in title, description and the worker.

 - c. My Todo Task to check the tasks that assigned to user.
 User can edit the time and completed status by clicking edit button.

 - d. My Assigned Task to check the tasks that user assigned to others or
 him/herself.
 They can modify the task's title, description and worker by clicking modify.
 For completed tasks, the user can only delete the task, but cannot modify them.
 For working tasks, the user can delete and modify the task.

5. After the user log out, the app will refresh later. Then user can log in
another account.

6. For the edit and modify part, I assume user will type brand new content, so
all the value is empty value.
